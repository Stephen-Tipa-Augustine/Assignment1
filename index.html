		This image illustrates how serious the issue of digital privacy has become over the recent years as accelerated by the advent of many social
		networking platforms such as facebook, twitter, whatsapp and many others.
		<br />This Platforms has conquered the heart every being of the 21st century.<br />As students of engineering dreaming to change the World in some 
		way we have to thing of how to suit the interest of digital privacy as well as our main topic.

		Currently due to the network of networks and its globalisation, i.e. The Internet many of our young generation do strngly believe that digital
		privacy is not a reality rather a fantacy. Many categories of identity theft, data theft occurs as a result of the black hat, red hat and many other 
		forms of hackers.<br />
		The fact is there is very much to do perhaps we start now.<br />
		The image on the left shows how someone can earsdrop your surfs, when you even don't think you are being monitored.

<p>I think we have fair enough given much time talking generally about digital privacy simply to just make sure you got it right,
thus believing so we would like to dive you deep into the main issue.<br /> So lets get started.</p>

<h2 id="intro"> Introduction To The Topic Of Study</h1>
<p> </p>
<div id="mydiv5">
<img id="image5" src="images/lock2.png.jpg" alt="Attributive image" title="Is privacy a reality"/>
	Perhaps could you ask yourself this question Digital Privacy actually means, this is quite an interesting question.
	<br />Down we present you the general view of what meaning this phrase carries.
</div>
<hr />

<p> </p>
<div id="mydiv6">
<img id="image6" src="images/privacy.png.jpg" alt="Attributive image" title="Digital Privacy Vs Digital Security"/>
	Remember Digital privacy is not data security many people may actually confuse these two, however these two phrases are all
	rendered in the same view most times.

</div>
<hr />

<p>
    Definition:<br />
    <dfn>DIGITAL PRIVACY: </dfn><br />
    Digital privacy refers to how one can use electronic systems or devices and the internet without compromising his/her personal information, controlling it and how it is used.<br /> This information should be in the owner’s comfort zone.
</p>
<h2 id="state"> The Current Global State Of DIGITAL PRIVACY</h1>
<p> 
    In this digital age, our data is stored in many places across the connected digital world. <br />We leave our digital trails through our phone companies, social media accounts, online accounts on some websites, financial transactions (especially when we use our credit cards in restaurants, fuel stations, supermarkets) and this information is stored. <br />This digital trail is being used by other companies especially the marketing companies to advertise their products and services for example receiving email addresses from companies you never directly shared your contact information with and also some law enforcers to access individuals’ information. Therefore, we have limited control over the accessibility of our information is used once we release it.
    <br />
    <br />
Ethically (under the social contract theory) the owner of the information has a positive right which obligates the third party to safely store the it without using it for some other cause without the owner’s consent.
</p>

<h2 id="case1">Case Study One(1)</h1>
<h3>CARPENTER Vs UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</h2>
<p>
<strong>Issue:</strong> <br />
“Following the arrest of four suspects for armed robberies in Michigan and Ohio, the FBI obtained a court order (under the Stored Communications Act) compelling Carpenter’s cellular service provider to produce basic subscriber information and three-month’s worth of cell site location records for a cellphone tied to Carpenter.<br /> The lower court found that the historical location data sought by the FBI were business records, which the government may obtain without a warrant.<br />Under the <strong><u>“third party doctrine,”</u></strong> <b>individuals have no reasonable expectation of privacy in information that they voluntarily provide to third parties.</b> <br />The doctrine arises out of <strong>two 1970s Supreme Court cases</strong> holding that the government does not need a warrant to obtain telephone or bank records relevant to criminal investigations from the phone companies or banks that create and maintain such records. <br />Numerous lower courts have applied the doctrine to cellular service providers’ collection of cell site signals transmitted by individual phones, generally reasoning that individuals ‘voluntarily’ transmit the cell site data to the provider.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ethical Dilemma:</strong> <br />
Cell phone companies which are third parties ought to safely store the individual’s information according to the social contract theory but Under the “Third Party doctrine,” individuals have no reasonable expectation of privacy in information that they voluntarily provide to third parties.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Arguments for the third-party doctrine.</strong><br />
<ul>
    <li>In case of criminal investigations, it helps the law enforcers to get evidence like phone records from telekom companies hence it saves time during information. </li>
    <li>One can retrieve personal information when one loses it. For example, ID numbers. </li>
    <li>For tracking purposes in case of accident casualties, stolen electronic devices among others. </li>
    <li>For research purposes like carrying out a study of the average number of Facebook users by contacting the facebook administration. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Arguments again the third-party doctrine.</strong> <br />
<ul>
    <li>Data submission is actually involuntary. </li>
    <li>Data security is not guaranteed. </li>
    <li>Some individuals are tempted to give wrong information. </li>
    <li>Possibility of identity theft in case of data breaches. </li>
    <li>Causes conflict among some fundamental rights. </li>
    <li>Some information is sold to other companies leading to spam emails. </li>
    <li>Makes individuals to blackmail e.g Hillary Clinton’s defamation scenarios in the 2016 USA presidential elections. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Analysis</strong> <br />
<ul>
    <li>Basing on the <b>rights theory</b>, <b>Third Party doctrine</b> compromises the right to <b>privacy</b>.</li>
    <li><b>Third Party doctrine</b> ignores individuals and look at the larger aspects i.e. <b>The collectivist theory</b>.</li>
	<p>Basing on <b>utilitarianism</b>, if this data (for example phone records) helps to curb crime and any threats to <b>national security</b>,
	then it’s for the greater good hence the <b>Third-Party doctrine</b> is good that way.</p>
	<p>A suspect who knows he/she can be incriminated when his information stored by the third parties is visited would never give permission to anyone
	top check that information or they may run into hiding when they realize the information is being referred to.</p>
	<p>Still basing <b>utilitarianism</b>, identifying accident victims by their cell phones or ATM cards found on them is another 
	advantage of accessing information stored by third parties because some victims may be unable to speak (identify themselves).</p>
	<p>Basing on the <b>individualist theory</b>, the <b>Third-Party doctrine</b> is not good because it <b>forces standards</b> on individuals 
	(data submission is involuntary) that is to say it does not allow them to choose how the information stored by 
	third parties is used and who can access it.<br /> Privacy of information is thus not <b>guaranteed.</b></p>	
</ul>
</p>

<strong>Conclusion and decision</strong>
<p>Ethically from the analysis above, with reference to <b>utilitarianism</b>, the <b>Third-Party doctrine</b> is okay just the way it is if it applies 
equally to everyone<b> (collectivist theory)</b> because the expected result is for the greater good and increases the aggregate happiness.<br /> 
The <b>individualist theory</b> is overruled because just makes the doctrine hard to apply or use.</p>
<p>Legally, this also supports the idea that the government does not require a search warrant to obtain personal information/data
 stored by <b>third parties</b>.</p>


<h2 id="case2">Case Study Two(2)</h1>
<h3>Apple vs FBI case</h3>
<p>
On December 2nd, 2015, 14 people were killed and 22 others were seriously injured in a terrorist attack consisting a mass shooting and an
 attempted bombing at the Inland Regional Centre Bernardino, California. The perpetrators Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeek Malik, 
 amarried couple living in the city of Relands, targeted  a san Bernadino County Department of public health training and Christmas party
 of about 80 employees in rented banquet room. Farook a U.S born citizen of Pakistani descent, who worked as a health department employee and 
 his wife Malik was a Pakistani born lawful permanent resident of the U.S. After the shooting, the couple fled in a rented Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV).
 Four hours later, police pursued their vehicle and killed them in shoot out, which also left two officers injured.
</p>

<p>
During the investigations of this case, FBI filed an application for an order of assistance under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. §1651, 
to compel Apple’s assistance in accessing that data and  FBI vs Apple  rised out an application that the agency filed with the a federal 
magistrate judge in California seeking assistance from Apple with the searching of an iphone that was seized during the investigation in the 
attacks in San Bernardino California. The FBI was unable to access data on the locked iPhone which was owned by the San Bernardino Health 
Department but used by one of the perpetrators and requested that the court order Apple to provide assistance in decrypting the phone.
 But Apple because Apple has no way to access encrypted data on the seized iPhone , the FBI applied for an order requiring Apple to create 
 a custom operating system that would disable key features on the iPhone. The court issued an order requiring that the custom hacking tool be 
 created and installed by Apple without unlocking or otherwise changing data on the phone.
</p>

<p>
Apple opposed the order on the grounds that its unlawful and un constitutional. They also argued that if the order is granted, 
it will undermine the security of all Apple devices and set a dangerous precedent for the future cases. They also claimed this would 
disable several security features that the FBI claims are preventing it from accessing the contents of the iPhone owned by one of the shooters. 
</p>

<p>
Privacy International and Human Rights Watch’s brief focused on the international implications should the Court compel Apple to assist the
 FBI by hacking its own iPhone. In particular, they discussed how other countries already seek the power to compel technology companies to undermine
 the security of their products or services, through hacking and other techniques. They argued that should the Court compel Apple to assist the FBI,
 it would encourage these countries to place heightened pressure on companies to comply. Their brief also touched upon the civil and human rights 
 abuses that can – and have – occurred when governments seek to exploit security weaknesses in technology products and service
</p>

<p>
However later the FBI hacked the iPhone by itself and it cost them $1.3m and this was admitted by the FBI director James Comey as he 
told the London audience on Thursday 21st April 2016.
</p>

<strong> Threats to digital privacy </strong>

<p>
The operating system would create a unique and grave threat of people’s privacy. It would permit the government the remote and surreptitious
 access to people’s personal devices and all the intimate information they store. It would also permit the government to conduct novel forms
 of real time surveillance by turning on a device microphone, camera or GPS based location technology or by capturing continuous screenshots
 or seeing anything input into and output from the device. Hacking allows governments to manipulate data on our devices by deleting, corrupting
 or planting data, recovering data that has been deleted or adding and even editing code to alter or add capabilities all while erasing any 
 trace of intrusion. This prey on user trust, and can undermine the security of systems and internet.
</p>

<p>
Most governments claim of consequences for every device for Global cyber security and for basic freedoms at home and around the world.
 Communication security is critical for the function of democracy and the precedent the government is seeking could do terrible and lasting 
 damage to people’s privacy. It would undermine some of the most important developments in digital privacy and security over the last few decades.
</p>

<p>
The malware that the government wants Apple to written would certainly be used as a mole to break into other iPhones thus invading people’s privacy.
</p>

<p>
Hard the government won this case, it would almost surely have a domino effect  leading to thousands such requests not just to Apple but to all
 consumer tech companies and if every tech company needs to be ready to write new back doors into is product, that means the introduction of scores
 of new vulnerabilities into the world and the more such backdoors exist, the more malicious actors will their efforts on seizing them thus 
 invading the privacy of people using the tech products making their data unsafe.
</p>

<p>
The human rights implications, the development would have a devastating impact on democracy and human rights activists and movements worldwide
 which depend on secure communication and privacy to flourish. 
</p>

<strong>Reasons justifying FBI’s request </strong>
<p>
During an Intelligence Squared Debate hosted by the National Constitution Center on June 7, experts on both sides of the issue discussed the finer
 points surrounding backdoors, encryption and what is expected of technology companies when it comes to collaborating with law enforcement.
</p>

<p>
As Stuart Baker, former assistant secretary for policy for the Department of Homeland Security under the George W. Bush administration, argued
 in favour of company cooperation with law enforcement. He said the matter boils down to little more than an obligation to assist whenever possible,
 something he said technology companies like Apple have not been doing.
</p>

<p>
He added that everybody is required to help law enforcement in the right circumstances, and he said. “If you have a unique ability to help law
 enforcement, and law enforcement can’t solve the problem on its own, you have an obligation to assist law enforcement. This has been true for
 hundreds of years, well before the United States was founded.”
</p>

<p>
The only justification that the FBI has to hack people’s phones is and invade on their privacy is security and for investigation purposes ignoring
 the consequences of their actions to digital privacy.
</p>

<p>
The FBI vs Apple case provides ethical dilemma for Apple in that it supposed to help government solve crime and promote security as well as 
protecting the privacy for the consumers of their products and maintaining their integrity and consumer trust.
